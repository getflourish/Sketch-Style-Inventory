# Style Inventory for Sketch

Design requires free, sometimes chaotic exploration. But design also means organisation and structure. Sketch can be good in both aspects, but moving from exploration to structured layouts with text styles and unified colors is hard. Either you start clean files from scratch, or you use what you have and try to tidy it up. The Style Inventory is meant to help you with that. It gives you an overview of all your used styles and helps you to merge styles of similar layers into one. Does select layer by color or select layer by text style ring a bell? :)

## Style Inventory
Generate a visual style sheet with all colors and text styles that you are using. This will help you to get an overview of your used styles so you can merge styles that are very close together. (-> Select all matching layers by color or text style) You can also export a SCSS or JSON file to use your styles in your web projects. (-> Style Inventory Tagger) When you run this plugin again, Sketch will update your Style Inventory while keeping variable names.
